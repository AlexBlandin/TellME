assume everyone is assembled in the "lobby" voice & text channel,
one user (me) will type `!play`,
  specifies gamemode (for now, just controls number of rounds in a game) (not important for now)
    "basic" is 1 round per game
    "twoturn" is 2 rounds per game (not important for now)
TellMe will connect to the author's location,
  query the channel for the list of users,
  clear any TellMe game roles ("canvote" & "speaking"),
  assign a random play order,
  announce the play order,
  move into the "speaking" voice & text channel
gameloop begins (individual turns of all players forming a round),
  TellMe knows the k'th player,
  gives them the "speaking" role,
  moves them into the "speaking" channels,
  gives them the rundown:
    f"The last sentence was: {ls}" if k!=0 else f"Tell me a {genre} story set in {location} with {item}"
    f"Your prompt words are: {' '.join(prompts)}"
    f"You will have {T} seconds to tell me a story. When there are ten seconds remaining, an alert will play."
    f"Your {T} seconds starts, now."
  records for 90s (bgm optional),
    alert at 10s remaining,
  announces that time is up,
    assigns them the "canvote" role,
    invites them to move back to the lobby and look at the voting text channel to vote momentatily,
    forcefully moves them and removes "speaking" role,
  runs recording through extractor,
  puts keywords up for voting,
    message with reacts 1 through 10,
    alert those in lobby by text and voice that they have 20s to vote,
    wait 20s,
    tally votes,
    `prompts = ` top 4 (ties settled by random sample),
    thank those who voted and delete the vote message,
  loop,
end of round,
  unassigns "canvote" role,
  (that's all for now), 
end of game,
  report back the combined story,
    including TellMe's rundown and the votes
  upload stitched together audio,
  thank,
  cleanup,
    remove TellMe game roles,
disconnect from voice.
