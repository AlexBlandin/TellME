So the, the murderer was the bear. I mean, it was crackers. The bear for a long time had been known to be one of the friendliest bears on the block. And it was hard to believe that a soft toy could be capable of such a brutal and gruesome murder where a stomach was ripped from its inside and wrapped around a weapon.

But this is what the inspector had decided. This is what the evidence pointed out. It was the bear. How did he know it was the bear? Well, firstly, they were the poor prints. They were covered in blood. That didn't look good. Secondly, not only were the other dolls in the house saying it was the bear, but the owner's child looked terrified every time it saw the Teddy bear, that once had been his closest confidant and friend.

This said this suspect, this said the inspector to the mother of the terrified child is always a sign that things have gone wrong. Do you mean like that film Chucky? She said the inspector nodded slowly it's like that film, but even worse. This bear that you've got is a very, very bad bear, but don't worry.

He said, I think there's someone that could help me solve it and put him behind bars for good. And might've waited. And the inspector nodded and said, To catch a bear. We need another bear. This is a job, not even for Rupert, but for one Mr. Pat intern Brown.
