## Installation

Ensure [Python3.7](https://python.org/) is installed. Tentatively, Python3.8 should work, but because Tensorflow is awkward we can't just blanket say "Python3.7 or later", since 3.9 doesn't work for now.

Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), open the `$ poetry shell` in the project directory (handles venv etc.), and use `$ poetry install`.

Install `libopus0`/`libopus` (depending on system) and `ffmpeg`.

## Running

While in the poetry shell, use `$ poetry run python3.7 tellme.py`
