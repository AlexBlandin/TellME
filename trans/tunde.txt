in the mountains of Switzerland there was a horror the goat's cheese had been stolen once again goats don't like their cheese being stolen which is why on this particular day the goat decided enough was enough and what you have to remember is that the goat was working incredibly hard just to produce any kind of cheese and this particular goat wasn't even one of the best ones and so when it found it's cheese missing in the morning things had to change now the thing about the mountains of Switzerland and goat herds is that the goat herds tend to need quite a lot of sleep and this is when our goat really a goat as in the greatest of all time decided enough was enough usually the goats are not but on this particular day armed with a Swiss army knife because only the best will do the goat crept ever so gently in to the lodge as the goatherd slept stood over the goatherd knife at the ready looked down at him and thought just for a moment as it unsheathed the blade am I really about to take a life for my cheese and the answer dear listener was yes very definitely yes
