Winters day and an old detective is walking in the streets of Paris he kept walking and walking trying to figure out this puzzling crime that he couldn't understand where to begin the only piece of evidence was a bloody rubber duck that's all he had to go with it was a bloody rubber duck in the middle of a forest he had no fingerprints he had no pieces of evidence except that bloodstain on the rubber duck so he thought who could it be who could have killed this person next to the rubber duck but as he kept thinking he realised there was something inside the rubber duck something he didn't consider and it was a note a note written in an old biro pen and this note said that if you try to find me you will die detective and so the detective knew that it was somebody that he must have worked with in the past it must have been somebody he's previously known but he couldn't known what it had been and a bear came out of nowhere and decided to eat the detective
