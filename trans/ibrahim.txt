it was in the middle of summers day and Timmy was walking for miles and he found himself stuck between two big mountains he tried to find his way out he had previous experience rock climbing but that wasn't enough so he kept on going and going to the nearest town as he was going he slipped into a small crevice and his foot got stuck he couldn't get out of it so the more he tried the harder you know he got entrenched inside that small crevice that hole as he was trying to get himself out he heard a baby crying this baby kept crying harder and harder and the more he struggled the more he heard the baby's voice getting louder so he noticed that within that small crevice under the small rock there was a small baby wrapped in a woollen blanket so that gave him enough strength he said to himself I have to save myself for this baby and he found the courage the strength to keep going to push himself out he managed to break himself free but he broke his leg as he got out he took the baby and he was limping with one leg now trying to go through the mountain thirty seconds yeah
