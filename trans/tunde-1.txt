so the murderer was the bear I mean it was crackers the bear for a long time had been known to be one of the friendliest bears on the block and it was hard to believe that a soft toy could be capable of such a brutal and grewsome murder where a stomach was ripped from its inside and wrapped around a weapon but this is what the Inspector had decided this is what the evidence pointed at it was the bear how did he know it was the bear well firstly there were the pawprints they were covered in blood that didn't look good secondly not only were the other dolls in the house saying it was the bear but the owners child looked terrified every time it saw the teddy bear that once had been its closest confidante and friend this said the this said the inspector to the mother of the terrified child is always the sign that things have gone wrong do you mean like that film Chucky she said the Inspector nodded slowly it's like that film but even worse this bear that you've got is a very very bad bear but don't worry he said I think there's someone that could help me solve it and put him behind bars for good the mother waited and the Inspector nodded and said to catch a bear we need another bear this is a job not even for Rupert but for one Mr Paddington Brown
